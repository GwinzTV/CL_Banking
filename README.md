## Introduction
Welcome to my Bank Management Application! This application allows you to create a user bank account, securely login, and perform various banking operations - such as depositing, withdrawing, and viewing your balance.

## About the Project
The Bank Management Application is built with a focus on security, modularity, and user-friendliness. It employs a custom authentication method that utilises SHA1 encryption for secure user logins. The application follows the principles of Separation of Concerns (SoC) and utilises the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clear separation of business logic, presentation, and user interaction. Object-oriented programming principles are at the heart of the application's design, allowing for extensibility and maintainability.
