## Introduction
Welcome to my Bank Management Application! This application allows you to create a user bank account, securely login, and perform various banking operations - such as depositing, withdrawing, and viewing your balance.

## About the Project
The Bank Management Application is built with a focus on security, modularity, and user-friendliness. It employs a custom authentication method that utilises SHA1 encryption for secure user logins. The application follows the principles of Separation of Concerns (SoC) and utilises the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clear separation of business logic, presentation, and user interaction. Object-oriented programming principles are at the heart of the application's design, allowing for extensibility and maintainability.

- **Design Pattern**: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Getting Started 🚀

### How to Run Application
**Disclaimer:** You must install Git and Python(v3.12 or newer) on your computer before proceeding with these instructions.
If you have these installed already, go ahead with the steps below.

   cd CL_Banking

2. **Create Database**:
Next, create the database using the setup script
   ```bash
   cd data
   python databaseCreation.py
You should see a file called "bank.db" in the data folder
